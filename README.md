# Impersonator Extension

<i><b>Log-in as ANY address on ALL dapps.</b></i><br />
<br />
Impersonator injects into the dapps just like Metamask, but gives you the freedom to set custom address which tricks the dapp into thinking you own that address.

## How to Install

<ol>
  <li>
    Download extension from the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/impersonator/hgihfkmoibhccfdohjdbklmmcknjjmgl">Chrome Web Store</a>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <b>NOTE:</b> Extension should not be installed along with Metamask, here are 3 different ways to avoid it:<br/>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        Create a new browser profile <br />

6. You can now open any dapp and connect wallet as Metamask. The dapp would detect your custom address and network.

<br />
‚≠ê Unique feature that differentiates it from other wallets: <b>You can have different address & chain injected in different browser tabs at the same time! </b><br /><br />
So in one tab you might have Uniswap connected to <code>Polygon</code> with <code>apoorv.eth</code> and in another one you can have Sushiswap connected to <code>Ethereum Mainnet</code> with <code>vitalik.eth</code>
